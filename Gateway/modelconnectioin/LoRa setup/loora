we are comminucate betwen lora and our device using 
serial and mqtt

first we have to identify which usb it connected using 

dmesg | grep tty
ls /dev/ttyUSB*


and the code in python you have to run 
in sudo lora_code.py

sudo python3 lora_code.py


if not give permission 
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
